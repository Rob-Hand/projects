# projects 
Hi! I have uploaded a couple projects here that I've worked on over the past year. Some of them are currently ongoing. Please feel free to look around, 
I hope you find them interesting. 

Here is a brief description of each:

GLMM Python Job Characteristics: I used a kaggle dataset of Glassdoor postings for data science - esque jobs to build visualize and build 
 a model exploring the relationship between whether I job wants Python skills and other characteristics of the job such as salary, job title, other requested skills, 
 and the companies Glassdoor rating. Funnily enough, this project was done using R. 
 
Clustering HDI, Gender Equality and Water Resources: Myself and a fellow graduate student at Loyola investigated whether there would be similarities in how world countries
cluster based on 1) HDI and Gender Equality indices, and 2) water resources and agriculture measures. This was a nice opportuntiy to do some map based
visalization of clusters. 

PCA and Spatial Visualization of Chicago community area public health measures. I performed principal component analysis of data on public health and safety measures
collected by the city of Chicago for Chicago's 77 official community areas. After PCA I did some visualization to understand what each principal component meant, and 
also saw some clear groupings of community areas emerging, so did some further visualization including mapping a color code of these groupings to the community areas. 

LASSO model predictions of Titanic Spaceship dataset. I'm playing around with several approaches currently to classify who was transported to an alternate dimensions on the 
spaceship Titanic for a kaggle competition. It's a fun one. For this one I wrote a function that takes in multiple imputed datasets and runs a lasso model with k-fold 
cross validation on each of the datasets, then assigned class predictions based on a majority vote for the ouput of each model. Almost 80% K-fold cv predictive accuracy. 
That can definitely go up, but this was a fun application of the lasso.
